# TMS-RGB #

## An RGB mod for systems using TMS9928A and TMS9929A graphics ##

This small adapter board can unlock the potential of many 8-bit systems from the 1980's including the Colecovision, SG-1000, SC-3000, TI-99/4, and more.

This solution introduces zero latency, works in NTSC or PAL systems, doesn't require any tuning, and can be installed easily.  TMS-RGB was developed in 2020 and solves all known issues found in previous TMS992xA mods of this kind.
